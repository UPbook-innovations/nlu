## NLU 1.1.2 Release Notes
### Hindi  WordEmbeddings , Bengali Named Entity Recognition (NER), 30+ new models, analyze Crypto news with John Snow Labs NLU 1.1.2 

We are very happy to announce NLU 1.1.2 has been released with the integration of 30+ models and pipelines Bengali Named Entity Recognition, Hindi Word Embeddings,
and state-of-the-art transformer based OntoNotes models and pipelines from the [incredible Spark NLP 2.7.3 Release](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/releases/tag/2.7.3) in addition to a few bugfixes.  
In addition to that, there is a [new NLU Webinar video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2141&v=hJR9m3NYnwk&feature=youtu.be) showcasing in detail 
how to use NLU to analyze a crypto news dataset to extract keywords unsupervised and predict sentimential/emotional distributions of the dataset and much more!

### [Python's NLU library: 1,000+ models, 200+ Languages, State of the Art Accuracy, 1 Line of code - NLU NYC/DC NLP Meetup Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2141&v=hJR9m3NYnwk&feature=youtu.be)
Using just 1 line of Python code by leveraging the NLU library, which is powered by the award-winning Spark NLP.

This webinar covers, using live coding in real-time,
how to deliver summarization, translation, unsupervised keyword extraction, emotion analysis,
question answering, spell checking, named entity recognition, document classification, and other common NLP tasks. T
his is all done with a single line of code, that works directly on Python strings or pandas data frames.
Since NLU is based on Spark NLP, no code changes are required to scale processing to multi-core or cluster environment - integrating natively with Ray, Dask, or Spark data frames.

The recent releases for Spark NLP and NLU include pre-trained models for over 200 languages and language detection for 375 languages.
This includes 20 languages families; non-Latin alphabets; languages that do not use spaces for word segmentation like
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean; and languages written from right to left like Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, and Hebrew.
We'll also cover some of the algorithms and models that are included. The code notebooks will be freely available online.

## Translation
[Translation example](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/nlu/blob/master/examples/colab/component_examples/sequence2sequence/translation_demo.ipynb)       
You can translate between more than 192 Languages pairs with the [Marian Models](https://marian-nmt.github.io/publications/)
You need to specify the language your data is in as `start_language` and the language you want to translate to as `target_language`.    
The language references must be [ISO language codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)

`nlu.load('<start_language>.translate.<target_language>')`

**Translate Turkish to English:**     
`nlu.load('tr.translate_to.fr')`

**Translate English to French:**     
`nlu.load('en.translate_to.fr')`


**Translate French to Hebrew:**     
`nlu.load('en.translate_to.fr')`

```python
translate_pipe = nlu.load('en.translate_to.fr')
df = translate_pipe.predict('Billy likes to go to the mall every sunday')
df
```

|	sentence|	translation|
|-----------|--------------|
|Billy likes to go to the mall every sunday	| Billy geht gerne jeden Sonntag ins Einkaufszentrum|

## Question Answering
[Question answering example](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/nlu/blob/master/examples/colab/component_examples/sequence2sequence/T5_tasks_summarize_question_answering_and_more))

Predict an `answer` to a `question` based on input `context`.    
This is based on [SQuAD - Context based question answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250)


|Predicted Answer | Question | Context | 
|-----------------|----------|------|
|carbon monoxide| What does increased oxygen concentrations in the patient’s lungs displace? | Hyperbaric (high-pressure) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of O 2 around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff. Carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene, and decompression sickness (the ’bends’) are sometimes treated using these devices. Increased O 2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin. Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in their blood. Increasing the pressure of O 2 as soon as possible is part of the treatment.
|pie| What did Joey eat for breakfast?| Once upon a time, there was a squirrel named Joey. Joey loved to go outside and play with his cousin Jimmy. Joey and Jimmy played silly games together, and were always laughing. One day, Joey and Jimmy went swimming together 50 at their Aunt Julie’s pond. Joey woke up early in the morning to eat some food before they left. Usually, Joey would eat cereal, fruit (a pear), or oatmeal for breakfast. After he ate, he and Jimmy went to the pond. On their way there they saw their friend Jack Rabbit. They dove into the water and swam for several hours. The sun was out, but the breeze was cold. Joey and Jimmy got out of the water and started walking home. Their fur was wet, and the breeze chilled them. When they got home, they dried off, and Jimmy put on his favorite purple shirt. Joey put on a blue shirt with red and green dots. The two squirrels ate some food that Joey’s mom, Jasmine, made and went off to bed,'|

`Summarizes` a paragraph into a shorter version with the same semantic meaning, based on [Text summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03340)

```python
# Set the task on T5
pipe = nlu.load('summarize')

# define Data, add additional tags between sentences
data = [
'''

'''  Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or "the calculus of infinitesimals", is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations. It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.[1] Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.[2][3] Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.[4] In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a Latin word, meaning originally "small pebble" (this meaning is kept in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for calculation, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.'''

##  NLU 1.0.6 Release Notes
### Trainable Multi Label Classifiers, predict Stackoverflow Tags and much more in 1 Line of with NLU 1.0.6
We are glad to announce NLU 1.0.6 has been released!
NLU 1.0.6 comes with the Multi Label classifier, it can learn to map strings to multiple labels.
The Multi Label Classifier is using Bidirectional GRU and CNNs inside TensorFlow and supports up to 100 classes.

### NLU 1.0.6 New Features
- Multi Label Classifier
   - The Multi Label Classifier learns a 1 to many mapping between text and labels. This means it can predict multiple labels at the same time for a given input string. This is very helpful for tasks similar to content tag prediction (HashTags/RedditTags/YoutubeTags/Toxic/E2e etc..)
   - Support up to 100 classes
   - Pre-trained Multi Label Classifiers are already avaiable as [Toxic](https://nlu.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/examples#toxic-classifier) and [E2E](https://nlu.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/examples#e2e-classifier) classifiers

####  Multi Label Classifier
- [ Train Multi Label Classifier on E2E dataset Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15ZqfNUqliRKP4UgaFcRg5KOSTkqrtDXy?usp=sharing)
- [Train Multi Label  Classifier on Stack Overflow Question Tags dataset Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Y0pYdUMKSs1ZP0NDcKgVECqkKD9ShIdc?usp=sharing)       
  This model can predict multiple labels for one sentence.
  To train the Multi Label text classifier model, you must pass a dataframe with a ```text``` column and a ```y``` column for the label.   
  The ```y``` label must be a string column where each label is seperated with a seperator.     
  By default, ```,``` is assumed as line seperator.      
  If your dataset is using a different label seperator, you must configure the ```label_seperator``` parameter while calling the ```fit()``` method.

By default *Universal Sentence Encoder Embeddings (USE)* are used as sentence embeddings for training.

```python
fitted_pipe = nlu.load('train.multi_classifier').fit(train_df)
preds = fitted_pipe.predict(train_df)
```

If you add a nlu sentence embeddings reference, before the train reference, NLU will use that Sentence embeddings instead of the default USE.
```python
#Train on BERT sentence emebddings
fitted_pipe = nlu.load('embed_sentence.bert train.multi_classifier').fit(train_df)
preds = fitted_pipe.predict(train_df)
```

Configure a custom line seperator
```python
#Use ; as label seperator
fitted_pipe = nlu.load('embed_sentence.electra train.multi_classifier').fit(train_df, label_seperator=';')
preds = fitted_pipe.predict(train_df)
```


### NLU 1.0.6 Enhancements
- Improved outputs for Toxic and E2E Classifier.
  - by default, all predicted classes and their confidences which are above the threshold will be returned inside of a list in the Pandas dataframe
  - by configuring meta=True, the confidences for all classes will be returned.


### NLU 1.0.6 New Notebooks and Tutorials

- [ Train Multi Label Classifier on E2E dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15ZqfNUqliRKP4UgaFcRg5KOSTkqrtDXy?usp=sharing)
- [Train Multi Label  Classifier on Stack Overflow Question Tags dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nmrncn-y559od3AKJglwfJ0VmZKjtMAF/view?usp=sharing)

### NLU 1.0.6 Bug-fixes
- Fixed a bug that caused ```en.ner.dl.bert``` to be inaccessible
- Fixed a bug that caused ```pt.ner.large``` to be inaccessible
- Fixed a bug that caused USE embeddings not properly beeing configured to document level output when using multiple embeddings at the same time

### Sentiment Classifier Training
[Sentiment Classification Training Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f-EORjO3IpvwRAktuL4EvZPqPr2IZ_g8?usp=sharing)

To train the Binary Sentiment classifier model, you must pass a dataframe with a 'text' column and a 'y' column for the label.

By default *Universal Sentence Encoder Embeddings (USE)* are used as sentence embeddings.

```python
fitted_pipe = nlu.load('train.sentiment').fit(train_df)
preds = fitted_pipe.predict(train_df)
```

If you add a nlu sentence embeddings reference, before the train reference, NLU will use that Sentence embeddings instead of the default USE.

```python
#Train Classifier on BERT sentence embeddings
fitted_pipe = nlu.load('embed_sentence.bert train.classifier').fit(train_df)
preds = fitted_pipe.predict(train_df)
```

```python
#Train Classifier on ELECTRA sentence embeddings
fitted_pipe = nlu.load('embed_sentence.electra train.classifier').fit(train_df)
